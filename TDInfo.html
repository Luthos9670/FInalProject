            <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
          </div>
      <p>The idea for this app was to let users list down as many tasks as they needed to complete.
        <br> They are also able to cross off tasks as they complete them or <br> completely delte them if needed. One of the big benifits of my app is <br> that it saves your changes into the browser so you don't have to worry about 
        your tasks being delted if you leave and come back. <br> Here is the link to the App: <br> <a href="TDEmbeded/Index.html" style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">To-Do List App</a>

            <h2>THE IDEA</h2>
          </div>
      <p>The program awaits a user to input text into the add task input bar, it will send out an alert if the button is clicked and their is no <br> text.
        If their is content when the button is clicked it uses a function to create a new list item in the html and fill it will the user input. <br> The cross out button works soley with css 
        to create a red line through the text area of the list. The X button works by removing the list item and then updating the local storage to keep it <br> removed. 
        It saves the data by writing it into the local storage and then calling this function after every button click so every action is saved.</p>
