        <h2 style="color: #970607;">THE IDEA</h2>
        The Idea for this project was to create a web page where the user would open the page and be presented with a team they would have to beat in a 5v5 situation. <br>
        They would shuffle through are massive list of players from the NBA and pick their personal all star line up within a certin budget we gave them. <br> The Program would then out put the winner

        <h2 style="color: #970607;">How It Works</h2>
        <p>The code works by using a massive array of players that contains their images, rating, cost and name. We created 10 player choise functions, one for each position on each team.
            Each position had their own function that would create a random number from 0 to the length of the array size for that position and then it would pull the information and photo id for that player
            and would then present it in the player box we create. <br>
            we created 3 types of buttons, single player shuffle button: 
            <br> A lock button and a shuffle all button. the single player shuffle button would activate the playershufle function corisponding to that position.
            <br> The lock function would disable the playershuffle button that was in the same container as it on the page. it would also then add the layer rating of the locked player into a team1rating array to be used later.
            <br> The shuffle all button would, on click, activate all of the personal player shuffle function buttons.
